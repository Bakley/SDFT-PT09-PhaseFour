We write oop and use an orm to connect to the database


Relationships in a relational database
1. One to One
 => One record in a table is linked to exactly on record in another
2. One to Many
 => One record in a table is linked to multiple records in another 
3. Many to Many

We've been using an orm
-> Define models
-> Manage Relationships
-> Handle database migrations

Key concepts
=> Foreign Keys
=> db.Relationships()
=> back_populates
=> Cascades
=> Database migrations
