We write oop and use an orm to connect to the database


Relationships in a relational database
1. One to One
 => One record in a table is linked to exactly on record in another
2. One to Many
 => One record in a table is linked to multiple records in another 
3. Many to Many
 => Multiple record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table

We've been using an orm
-> Define models
-> Manage Relationships
-> Handle database migrations

Key concepts
=> Foreign Keys
=> db.Relationships()
=> back_populates
=> Cascades
=> Database migrations
=> Database normalization


Many to Many Key concepts
=> Association Table/Join Table:
    #=> A table that links two table in a many-to-many Relationships
    #=> It only stores a pair of foreign key
    A simple table with two columns
    Used when you don't need extra details, only used to see whose connected

A soldier is in multiple teams, and a team can have multiple soldiers
